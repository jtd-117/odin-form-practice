## About:
A basic sign-up form that utilises HTML validation, [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/), & minimal JavaScript for password confirmation.

## Sass Commands:
As this is my first project using Sass, the below commands are for my convenience:
> sass styles.scss styles.css

> sass --watch styles.scss styles.css

## Note:
This project is based on [project 6 (Sign-up Form)](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-intermediate-html-and-css-sign-up-form) of the [Full Stack JavaScript](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript) course offered by [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/dashboard) under the [Intermediate HTML & CSS](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/intermediate-html-and-css) course.
